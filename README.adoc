= jcli
:nofooter:

Sugared wrappers to execute methods from JDK and JVM-based libraries from the command line.

E.g., To generate a UUID, java.util.UUID contains a method, `UUID.randomUUID()`. This tool helps you to execute that method by invoking `jcli util -uuid`.

== Motivation
The goal is to expose the wealth of utility methods available in the JVM ecosystem right at the command line.

It is also intended that this be a GraalVM-compatible project so that distributions do not require the end user to do a JVM setup with some compatible Java version.

Most methods return a single result, and so can be used in pipe operations combined with other command line utilities if needed.

== Available Commands

In order to view the latest document, you can run the help for a command or sub-command.

E.g., `jcli time -help`
```
Usage: jcli time [-hV] [-now] [-toEpochMilli]
Methods from java.time
  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit.
      -now, --now   Prints the value of Instant.now()
      -toEpochMilli, --toEpochMilli, -toEpochMillis, --toEpochMillis
                    Prints the value of Instant.now().toEpochMillis()
  -V, --version     Print version information and exit.
```

Here is a small sample of available options.

|time
|`-now`
|Prints the value of current time as standard formatted date/time
|`jcli time -now`

|time
|`-toEpochMilli`
|Prints the value of current time as the number of milliseconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

== Build

To build this project's source code:

. Clone this project
. At the root of the project, execute `./gradlew clean build`
. The build generates a jar at `build/libs`. To execute the cli app, run `java -jar build/libs/jcli-0.1-all.jar -h` to view the help manual.
. Or, create an alias like this. `alias jcli='java -jar build/libs/jcli-0.1-all.jar'`
Then run, `jcli -h`.

== Build Native Image

. Install and Use GraalVM
. Compile Native Image
.. NativeCompile may take a few minutes (~7 minutes on My Intel / i5 / 8GB Mac)

```
sdk install java 17.0.8-graalce
sdk use java 17.0.8-graalce
./gradlew nativeCompile
```

The default output directory is `build/native/nativeCompile`.

Here is how you can execute the native file.
```
$ ./build/native/nativeCompile/jcli --help
Usage: jcli [-hvV] [COMMAND]
Sugared wrappers to execute methods of JDK and JVM-based libraries from the
command line.
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --verbose   Print welcome message.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  time    Methods from java.time
  util    Methods from java.util
  string  Methods from java.lang.String
```

An example command:

`$ ./build/native/nativeCompile/jcli time -fn=getEpochSecond`
